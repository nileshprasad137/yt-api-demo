### YouTube API v3 Minimalistic Demo  
  
Very Simple demo to fetch videos from YouTube playlist. Can be used as learning  resource to make calls to YouTube API for obtaining public data.  
  
In order to obtain private data, OAUTH integration would need to be done,    which is not implemented here.  
  
Add your APIKEY in `project.properties` file in order to run this application.  
  
Also add `org.json.simple` dependency in your classpath. Get dependency from [here](https://code.google.com/archive/p/json-simple/).
